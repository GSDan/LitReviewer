# Lit Reviewer

*A little script to help combine multiple CSVs of paper reviews*

Needs to be adapted to different review templates

- Run 'npm install'
- Place each reviewer's csv in the /reviews folder, with the format reviewerName.csv (e.g. "Dan.csv")
- Update LitReviewer.js to reflect your template
- Run with 'node LitReviewer.js'
